# Performer Tag Replace

This plugin provides the ability to replace text in performer tags. Once installed a settings page will be added to Picard's options, which is where the plugin is configured.

This plugin reads the track metadata provided to Picard, extracts the list of associated instrument and vocal performers, and updates the performer keys based on the original/replacement pairs specified in the settings panel.
